# React

`To create a  react app called my-app, run this command:`

<pre> npx create-react-app my-app
  cd my-app
  npm start </pre>
  
  ## Hooks
  ### useEffect
  - By default, it runs both after the first render and after every update.
  - Placing useEffect inside the component lets us access the count state variable (or any props) right from the effect.
